## Contractors
These are interval contractors implemented here; in the future they may be substituted by established libraries, as [IntervalRootFinding.jl]()
```@autodocs
Modules = [Base, 
            RigorousInvariantMeasures]
Pages = ["Contractors.jl"]
```

## Preimages
Optimized methods to compute preimages of ``1`` dimensional maps.

```@autodocs
Modules = [Base,
